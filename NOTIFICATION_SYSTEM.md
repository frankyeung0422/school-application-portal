2. Generate an App Password
3. Use the App Password in your `.env` file

### SendGrid Setup (Alternative)
1. Create a SendGrid account
2. Get your API key
3. Update the email service configuration

## Customization

### Adding New Schools
1. Add school to the monitoring system via API

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Email Not Sending**
   - Check email credentials in `.env`
   - Verify email service configuration
   - Check firewall/network settings

2. **Monitoring Not Working**
   - Verify MongoDB connection
   - Check school website URLs
   - Review monitoring logs

3. **Notifications Not Appearing**
   - Check user authentication
   - Verify notification preferences
   - Review notification processing logs

### Logs
Monitor the backend console for:
- Monitoring job execution
- Email sending status
- Error messages and debugging information

## Security Considerations

- Passwords are hashed using SHA-256
- Email tokens for password reset
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure MongoDB connection

## Future Enhancements

- **SMS Notifications**: Add SMS support for urgent notifications
- **Mobile App**: Native mobile application
- **Advanced Analytics**: Detailed monitoring statistics
- **Machine Learning**: Improved content analysis
- **Multi-language Support**: Support for multiple languages
